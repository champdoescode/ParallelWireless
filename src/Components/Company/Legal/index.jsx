            organization and to opt-in to their program. In each such instance,

            <a href="mailto:info@parallelwireless.com">

            to you by Parallel. You should know that opting out or unsubscribing

            <strong>5. Security</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Parallel uses industry accepted data collection and encryption
            methodologies in an attempt to ensure the secure collection and
            transmission of sensitive user information. While we try our best to
            safeguard your personal information once we receive it, no
            transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network
            can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>6. IP Addresses</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically
            assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever
            you access the Internet. This number may be the same each time you
            access the Internet, or it may change. Like other Internet sites,
            Parallel uses IP addresses to collect aggregate information about
            numbers of visitors and Site usage. The address is logged on our
            server when your computer requests information from Parallel.
            Parallel reserves the right, in rare instances, to use IP addresses
            to identify individuals who threaten our site, service, or users.

            <strong>How we use personal data</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to Section 3 above, Parallel will use your personal data
            based on:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Our legitimate business interests: For example, when you provide
              your information to us in connection with marketing offers or
              solutions feedback. You may have the right to object to this use
              of your personal data. Please review the “Opting Out” and “Data
              Subject Rights” sections for more information.
            </li>
            <li>
              Contract: For example, we may process personal information of
              business contacts to establish a contract for goods or services
              between you and Parallel, maintain contact points, and send you
              invoices for ordered goods or services.
            </li>
            <li>
              Legal obligation: For example, when it is reasonably necessary for
              Parallel to retain your personal data to comply with a legal
              obligation on Parallel, such as tax laws, export control
              compliance, or to exercise or defend our legal rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consent: We will rely on your consent to retain and use your
              personal data if no other basis is relevant. You may have the
              right to object or withdraw your consent. Please review the
              “Opting Out” and “Data Subject Rights” sections for more
              information.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Data Transfers</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            To provide our products and services, including employment services,
            Parallel may transfer data across Parallel’s affiliate companies in
            different geographic locations. When we transfer personal data from
            the E.U. to the U.S., we do so in compliance with appropriate
            safeguards, such as signing E.U. Standard Contractual Clauses.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Data Subject Rights</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Your local law may provide you with rights regarding the
            distribution and use of your personal data. For example, GDPR gives
            residents of the EU rights that they can exercise free of charge,
            including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Right to correct your personal information</li>
            <li>Right to withdraw consent</li>
            <li>Right to access your personal data</li>
            <li>Right to data portability</li>
            <li>Right to data deletion</li>
            <li>Right to object to processing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>8. Notice to California Residents</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Except with regard to the alternative detailed below, residents of
            the State of California have the right to request a list of all
            third parties to which a company conducting business in California
            has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for
            direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if
            the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or
            opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties
            for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with
            information on how to exercise this choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parallel qualifies for this alternative option. We have a
            comprehensive privacy policy and provide you with details on how you
            may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information
            by third parties for direct marketing purposes. We are not required,
            therefore, to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that
            received your personal information for marketing purposes during the
            preceding year.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>9. Children’s Privacy</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Site is intended for adults. We do not intentionally or
            knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children
            under the age of 13. We request that children under the age of 13
            not submit any information on the Site.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>10. Other Websites</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies only as long as you remain on the Site.
            Once you leave the Site, we have no control over your privacy or
            security issues even if you reached the other site by clicking on a
            link within the Site.
